# Library

## Overview:

This is another project from TOP curriculum. It is about creating a simple library website that you can use to store your favorite books by providing the website with some informations about the books (title, author...) you can also remove the books from the library and also change their status to either 'Read' or 'Not read'.

The main purpose of this project is to practice using objects in JS and to solidify my understanding of the prototype concept and how it works.

## What I learned:
- How to create a popup.
- How to create a obj constructor
- How to add functions to the constructor prototype
- How to use 'this' keyword in these functions.
